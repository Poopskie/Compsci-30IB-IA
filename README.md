# Compsci-30IB-IA

For my Computer Science Internal Assesment I helped a client make an online consent form filler.
This webapp encorporates Flask and SQLAlchemy to store and collect form data,
and FPDF2 to convert Database columns into pdfs

<br>

# How to Import

1. Clone Repo (download zip file attacted)
2. Create virtual env -> [python3 -m venv env]
3. Activate virtual env -> [./env/bin/activate]
4. Download libraries -> [pip install -r requirements.txt]
5. Make sure using correct python (one in environment)
6. Done

# Using the App

Start the webapp by running: "run.py"

Run "pdf.py" to convert existing forms in the database into pdfs

Check the console to see logs and users using the app

# Other Notes

Before you begin:
1. Make sure you have python installed as well as pip
2. Make sure virtualenv is installed using pip
